				<p>This project proposes to translate open research outputs in agriculture into Ethiopian local languages like Amharic, and to communicate scientific terms in plain language that farmers can understand. The translations will be openly available to farmers and the general public using an online platform to facilitate citizen engagement in open science, including data collection and data analysis, with the expectation that citizen involvement will increase agricultural productivity. <em>A Touch of Evil</em> Don't trust me. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
